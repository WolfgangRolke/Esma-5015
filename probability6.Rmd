## Functions of a R.V. - Transformations

####**Example** 

say $X\sim U[0,1]$ and $\lambda>0$. What is the pdf (density?) of the random variable $Y=-\lambda \log(X)$?

Solution: we first find the cdf and then the pdf as follows:

![](graphs/prob61.png)
 if y>0. For y<0 note that P(-logX<y) = 0 because 0<X<1, so logX<0, so -logX>0 always.
 
This is an example  of a function (or transformation) of a random variable. These transformations play a major role in probability and statistics. We will see how to find their pdf's (density's) on a few  examples.

###**Example** 
Say X is the number of roles of a fair die until the first six. We have already seen that $P(X=x) = 1/6*(5/6)^{x-1}$, x=1,2,.. Let Y be 1 if X is even, 0 otherwise. Find the density of Y.

Note: here both X and Y are discrete.

let's do this a little more general, with p instead of 1/6. Also let q=1-p=5/6. Then

and P(Y=0) = 1 - P(Y=1) = 6/11.

####**Example** 
Say we have a fair coin. We flip the coin until the first "Heads". What is the probability this will happen on an even-numbered flip?

Now we have the same as above, with p=0.5, so 

P(Y=1)=0.5/(1+0.5)=1/3.

Is there a loaded coin with probability of heads p so that the probability of "first heads on even-numbered flip" is 1/2?

Now P(Y=1)=q/(1+q)=1/2, so 2q=1+q or q=1 or p=0, but if p=0 we never get "heads", so no such coin exists!

###**Example** 
say X is a continuous r.v with pdf $f_X(x) = 1/2\exp(-|x|)$. This is called a double exponential. Let $Y=I_{[-1,1]}(X)$. Find the density of Y.

Note: here X is continuous and Y is discrete.

####**Example** 
again let X have pdf $f_X(x) = 1/2\exp(-|x|)$. Let $Y =X^2$. Then for y<0 we have P(Y$\le$y) = 0. So let y>0. Then

Next up some  examples of functions of random vectors:

####**Example** 
say (X,Y) is a bivariate standard normal r.v, that is it has joint density given by

![](graphs/prob65.png)

Let the r.v. (U,V) be defined by U = X+Y and V  = X-Y. Find the joint pdf of (U,V)

To start let's define the functions $g_1(x,y) = x+y$ and  $g_2(x,y) = x-y$, so that $U=g_1(X,Y)$ and $V = g_2(X,Y)$.

For what values of u and v is $f_{(U,V)}(u,v)$ positive? Well, for any values for which the system of 2 linear equations in two unknowns u=x+y and u=x-y has a solution.

These solutions are 

$$x = h_1(u,v) = (u + v)/2$$ 
$$y = h_2(u,v) = (u - v)/2$$

From this we find that for any (u,v) there is a unique (x,y) such that u=x+y and v=x-y. So the transformation $(x,y) \rightarrow.png) (u,v)$ is one-to-one and therefore has a Jacobian given by

![](graphs/prob66.png)

Now from multivariable calculus we have the following:

![](graphs/prob67.png)

Note that the density factors into a function of u and a function of v. This is not only a necessary but also a sufficient condition for U and V to be independent.

####**Example** 
say X and Y are independent standard normal r.v.'s. Let Z = X + Y. Find the pdf of Z.

Note: Z = X + Y = U in the  example  above, so the pdf of Z is just the marginal of U and we find

![](graphs/prob68.png)

Say X and Y are two continuous independent r.v with pdf f's f_X and f_Y, and let Z = X+Y. If we repeat the above calculations we can show that in general the pdf of Z is given by

![](graphs/prob69.png)

This is called the convolution formula. 

There is a second method for deriving the convolution formula which is useful. It uses a continuous analog to the law of total probability:

In the setup from above we have 

![](graphs/prob611.png)

The tricky part of this is the interchange of the derivative and the integral. Working with densities and cdfs usually means they are ok.

####**Example** 
Say $X_1, .., X_n$ are iid U[0,1]. Let $M=\max\{X_1, .., X_n\}$. Find $f_M$.
